SHPersian
=========


SHPersian is a set of tools for Persian/Arabic iOS Apps developers.

This package includes required classes to add custom look and feel to texts in your Persian iOS apps.

This also includes custom controls with built-in custom Persian font support out of the box.


## How to Use

You may take a look at the sample project to get how to use the SHControls. It's so simple.

For apps that show Persian/Arabic texts in UILabels, You may just change the class name for the UILabel to SHLabel. Then add a row with "Font" for title, and your custom font name as String value in the "User Defined Runtime Attributes" section in your storyboard. That's all. Your text will now render in your custom font look.
